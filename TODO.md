# TODOs for Coagulopathy Algorithm
[] Scale the inputs of the TST
[x] Generate global feature importances
[] Generate local feature importance
[x] Modify inclusion criteria
[x] Modify postprocessor
[] More options for tuning of TST based on other layer types available in the original github repo
[] Modify TST to do regression instead of classification
[] Measure RMSE instead of AUC
[] Verify that models do not have access to the measurement they are trying to predict
[] Run more intense integrated gradients method on CCV
